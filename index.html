    <p>Hello! You've made it to my website. Excuse the stark amount of white space, I'm still working on it!</p>
    <p>For now, all I have for you are some projects that I've been working on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a target="_blank" href="/Wordle/index.html">A wordle clone</a> I made from following an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wak7iN4JZzU"> online tutorial</a></li>
      <li><a target="_blank" href="/2048/index.html">A 2048 clone</a> that I made from messing around with concepts I learned from recreating wordle</li>

      <h2 class="date">02/20/2022</h2>
      <p> I have a lot in mind for what I want to do with this site. I'm writing these things down not only so I can share my progress with you, my dear reader, but so I have my
        goals salient in words. Often times, we forget what we want in life. That's a part of why so many new years resolutions go unresolved (that and sometimes we just don't want to
        meet our goals bad enough). It really helps to speak your mind in some sort of journal, or blog(atog) so you at least have a physical reminder of what you're gunning for.
        <br>
        A couple of things I've been thinking about:
        <ul>
          <li>Implement a commenting function</li>
          <li>Implement a sort by date or tag so I can categorize my blog posts</li>
          <li>Maybe move my blog to another .html file, so that I can use this space for more portfolio related matters</li>
          <li>Port my website off github and into my own AWS server of course</li>
          <li>Rewrite everything with React</li>
        </ul>

      <h1 class="title">Web server hosting</h1>
      <h2 class="date">02/20/2022</h2>
      <p> Eventually, I'll have to get off of hosting my website on Github Pages. I need a little more... privacy. I don't like hosting my files on a github repository that is ultimately discoverable if
        people know enough information about me. As a matter of fact, I'm not too pleased one would be able to find my source repo off this site. Granted, I do keep a tight lid on my personal information. 
        That is no excuse not to practice dilligence in maintaining privacy. I've been shopping around lately. Today my mind has been set on setting up an AWS EC2 enviroment just to screw around, make 
        mistakes and learn as much as I can.

      <h1 class="title">Bootstrap vs raw CSS</h1>
      <h2 class="date">02/19/2022</h2>
      <p>Two article entries in one day??? Wow!!!! I'm on a roll! I've been talking to some friends about whether or not my website should implement Bootstrap, or keep it pure handwritten CSS. I don't know how it's going
        to play with React since I barely know anything about the framework, but I have a feeling that its better for my learning that I stick to CSS. The point of this website is to learn as much as I can about web development
        and making my own stylesheet only helps hone my craft. The reasons why I might want to abandon CSS entirely is rather enticing, however. It's a lot easier to skim whatever button or nav-bar strikes your fancy and construct it by giving a tag some class names. 
        I won't do that though, because CSS is rather fun for me (in a masochistic sort of way I guess). Maybe I haven't done enough to out right hate it the same way how I have a strong distaste to python coding. Only time will tell, and you'll be able to read
        (or don't, it doesn't matter because I'll still do it anyways) me complain about CSS in a future blog entry. I've already vented my negative opinions about Javascript to my friends many times over.

      <h2 class="date">02/19/2022</h2>
      <p>Hello! This website means a lot to me. It's been something that I've been putting off for a while, and now I'm really putting in the work to make it servicable. I have plans to "port" 
        this website and make it strictly React, but that's still a framework that I'm learning. I suspect that some time in the future the website will be exclusively written in React, but for now it's
        your bread and butter HTML, CSS and JS.
