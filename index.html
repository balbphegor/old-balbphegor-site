    <p>Hello! You've made it to my website. HTML, CSS and Javascript all hand crafted by yours truly. Excuse the stark amount of white space, I'm still working on it!</p>
    <p>For now, all I have for you are some projects that I've been working on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a target="_blank" href="/Wordle/index.html">A wordle clone</a> I made from following an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wak7iN4JZzU"> online tutorial</a></li>
      <li><a target="_blank" href="/2048/index.html">A 2048 clone</a> that I made from messing around with concepts I learned from recreating wordle</li>

      <p>Two article entries in one day??? Wow!!!! I'm on a roll! I've been talking to some friends about whether or not my website should implement Bootstrap, or keep it pure handwritten CSS. I don't know how it's going
        to play with React since I barely know anything about the framework, but I have a feeling that its better for my learning that I stick to CSS. The point of this website is to learn as much as I can about web development
        and making my own stylesheet only helps hone my craft. The reasons why I might want to abandon CSS entirely is rather enticing, however. It's a lot easier to skim whatever button or nav-bar strikes your fancy and construct it by giving a tag some class names. 
        I won't do that though, because CSS is rather fun for me (in a masochistic sort of way I guess). Maybe I haven't done enough to out right hate it the same way how I have a strong distaste to python coding. Only time will tell, and you'll be able to read me
        (or don't, it doesn't matter because I'll still do it anyways) in a future blog entry.

      <p>Hello! This website means a lot to me. It's been something that I've been putting off for a while, and now I'm really putting in the work to make it servicable. I have plans to "port" 
        this website and make it strictly React, but that's still a framework that I'm learning. I suspect that some time in the future the website will be exclusively written in React, but for now it's
        your bread and butter HTML, CSS and JS.
