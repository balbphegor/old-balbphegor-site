      <h1 class="title">Day 3 in React</h1>
      <h2 class="date">02/22/2022</h2>
      <p> Today is my third day learning React. I'll admit, my appreciation for React is growing everyday as I realise that what I'm learning speeds up my workflow by orders of magnitudes. I could make each of these blog posts from a single component since they're already nicely compartmentalized into divs with ids of "blog", with title and date tags. Easily done and very elementary in React.
      <br><br>
      I should have learned React a lot sooner. I'm currently learning react using this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UZrsTqkcW4">video</a> which is a 10 hour comprehensive course. I'm doing an hour of this video everyday because I can't commit myself to watching more. I just get too distracted and I eventually click off to play video games or something.
      <br><br>
      I have been also working on some courses on Codeacademy as well. I opted to do the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101">Learn React</a> course to give myself some exercises and "course work" to get busy with. I'm not exactly enjoying this course, as it seems to use outdated/conflicting syntax from what I am acustomed to from the 10 hour video. For example, it advocates that one should always create a class which extends from <code>react.Component</code> with a <code>render(){}</code> function embeded in. I believe that <code>function Component()</code> (or for those who like arrow functions <code>const Component = () => {}</code>) works just as well. Needless to say, I'm still learning so there might be a very compelling reason why CodeAcademy advocates new learners to start using React in this manner. <br>

      UPDATE: So I found this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/react-choose-functional-components">brilliant technical article</a> that compares the two methods of component creation I previously commented on. It should've been obvious when I first saw CodeAcademy's implementation of creating components by making classes which extend from <code>React.Component</code>. Extending them from the <code>React.Component</code> object in <code>react</code> is nice because it does what it says on the box: it's a class that houses the component. It's a factory that allows for getters and class functions which you can use when envoking <code>render()</code> instead of flanking your <code>function Component(){}</code> with other extreneous helper functions. Relevant constants stay within the scope of the class where they're relevant instead of floating around in global. I quite like this, but I still think I prefer creating my components with <code>function Component(){}</code>. For only spending 3 days with an average of maybe 2-3 hours on React, I'm really digging this framework. I just hope that the rest of the MERN stack is as enjoyable to learn.
      <br><br>
      Oh, and happy 22/02/2022. For those who are uninitiated with basketball and the thinking man's NBA team the Miami Heat: it's Jimmy Butler Day.

      <h1 class="title">HELL</h1>
      <h2 class="date">02/20/2022</h2>
      <p> Oh lord. So I started learning React. Little did I know how ill prepared I was to start. To set up the enviroment on my gaming desktop was definitely a mistake. Not only did it provide a wealth of distractions
        with Apex Legends so easily accessible, I was fighting Windows on getting the Linux subsystem working after many years of neglect. I spent a large amount of time (longer than it should because I am sleep deprived
        at 6:42pm having woke up today at 4:30am and only getting 5 hours of sleep) setting up a React enviroment only for npx to cry like a petulant child because I was missing some packages. I could fix this
        by updating npx and npm, but frankly I could not be bothered to do so. I've moved everything to my Macbook, so everything should be easier. I faced a lot of set backs today so I have some ground to make up. 
        I'll work to a point where I'm happy to leave off, then I'll reward myself by sleeping like an old man at 10:00pm.
        <br>
        <br>
        I've descended into React hell, and I'm not leaving until I meet the devil.

      <h1 class="title">TODO</h1>
      <h2 class="date">02/20/2022</h2>
      <p> I have a lot in mind for what I want to do with this site. I'm writing these things down not only so I can share my progress with you, my dear reader, but to have my
        goals salient in words. It really helps to speak your mind in some sort of journal, or blog(atog) so you at least have a physical reminder of what you're gunning for.
        <br> <br>
        A couple of things I've been thinking about:
        <ul>
          <li>Implement a commenting function</li>
          <li>Implement a sort by date or tag so I can categorize my blog posts</li>
          <li>Maybe move my blog to another .html file, so that I can use this space for more portfolio related matters</li>
          <li>Port my website off github and into my own AWS server of course</li>
          <li>Rewrite everything with React</li>
        </ul>
        First, I should probably learn how to use React - that would be the best way to begin tackling this list of goals. I want to be comfortable with React before I go off and pivot into 
        storing my stuff on a AWS E2 cloud drive. My plan is to write my website in React, start the AWS E2 web service and host my website from there. Then, I'll implement all the "fun" 
        features I have in mind like storing comments on a mongoDB database on the web service and then work to compartmentalize each blog entry into some sort of text file on the server and 
        serve up each blog post instead of hard coding each blog post into the index html like I'm doing right now.
        <br> <br>
        Boy, I have a lot on my plate.

      <h1 class="title">Web server hosting</h1>
      <h2 class="date">02/20/2022</h2>
      <p> Eventually, I'll have to get off of hosting my website on Github Pages. I need a little more... privacy. I don't like hosting my files on a github repository that is ultimately discoverable if
        people know enough information about me. As a matter of fact, I'm not too pleased one would be able to find my source repo off this site. Granted, I do keep a tight lid on my personal information. 
        That is no excuse not to practice dilligence in maintaining privacy. I've been shopping around lately. Today my mind has been set on setting up an AWS EC2 enviroment just to screw around, make 
        mistakes and learn as much as I can.

      <h1 class="title">Bootstrap vs raw CSS</h1>
      <h2 class="date">02/19/2022</h2>
      <p>Two article entries in one day??? Wow!!!! I'm on a roll! I've been talking to some friends about whether or not my website should implement Bootstrap, or keep it pure handwritten CSS. I don't know how it's going
        to play with React since I barely know anything about the framework, but I have a feeling that its better for my learning that I stick to CSS. The point of this website is to learn as much as I can about web development
        and making my own stylesheet only helps hone my craft. The reasons why I might want to abandon CSS entirely is rather enticing, however. It's a lot easier to skim whatever button or nav-bar strikes your fancy and construct it by giving a tag some class names. 
        I won't do that though, because CSS is rather fun for me (in a masochistic sort of way I guess). Maybe I haven't done enough to out right hate it the same way how I have a strong distaste to python coding. Only time will tell, and you'll be able to read
        (or don't, it doesn't matter because I'll still do it anyways) me complain about CSS in a future blog entry. I've already vented my negative opinions about Javascript to my friends many times over.

      <p>Hello! This website means a lot to me. It's been something that I've been putting off for a while, and now I'm really putting in the work to make it servicable. I have plans to "port" 
        this website and make it strictly React, but that's still a framework that I'm learning. I suspect that some time in the future the website will be exclusively written in React, but for now it's
        your bread and butter HTML, CSS and JS.
